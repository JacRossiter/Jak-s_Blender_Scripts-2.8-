Layout switcher scripts for switching between ui layouts while transfering 3d view information. 
This helps keep the user oriented when switching so they dont have to refind the piece they are working on every time they switch layout.

To use:
enable stored views addon (default inside of blender 2.79).
Initialize stored views.
save current view twice inside of stored views (located in 'n' panel)
Execute my script from 3d view twice.
